 ### Project Idea
 
 The main goal is to solve a machine learning classification problem using Tensorflow and Cloud TPU (using free trial) and analyze the performance of our solution on TPU vs conventional GPU. 
 In addition to that, I also aim to parallelize the machine learning algorithm and analyze its performance.
 
 The dataset I am planning to use for this project is the Google's Open Images Dataset, which has about 9 million annotated images. Using such a large dataset can help us realize whether using TPU and/or parallelization can help us save a lot of time during training.
